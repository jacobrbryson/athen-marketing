        The Teach-First Method: The Ultimate Path to Mastery.

        Science shows that **teaching a concept is the best way to learn it.** Athena is the AI
        companion specifically designed to be taught by your child, transforming passive learning
        into active mastery.

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">The Child Teaches</h3>
          <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
            The "Younger Sibling" AI is intentionally programmed to know **one year less** than your
            child. Your child has to explain concepts clearly, answer Athena's thoughtful (and
            slightly naive) questions, and correct its genuine mistakes.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 font-bold">
            **Learning is Reinforced Immediately:** When the child successfully teaches a correct
            concept, Athena remembers it. If the child attempts to teach an incorrect idea, the AI
            gently responds with a phrase like,
            <em class="text-purple-700">"I'm sorry, I don't think that's right,"</em> and coaches
            the child toward the correct answer.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-purple-700 font-medium">
            **Benefit:** Builds supreme confidence and forces articulation of knowledge while gently
            correcting misconceptions.

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Athena Identifies Gaps</h3>
          <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
            Athena operates on **pre-loaded learning targets** for your child's age and grade. When
            the child struggles to teach or when the AI "gets confused," Athena's system flags that
            concept by cross-referencing it with the target curriculum. These targets are fully
            **customizable by parents and teachers**.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
            It then **spontaneously generates a mini-review session** or a brief, gamified quiz to
            reinforce that *exact* topic. All identified gaps are also highlighted in the
            parent/teacher reports and are continuously enforced by the AI.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-teal-700 font-medium">
            **Benefit:** Targeted, immediate practice exactly where it's needed—not generic
            drills—and **full alignment with core curriculum.**
